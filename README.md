In today's fast-paced world, people often struggle to preserve and reflect on their personal memories, leading to cognitive decline and mental health issues. Reflectify aims to address this by providing an engaging platform that supports users in improving their memory, cognitive functioning, and overall mental health. Using AI to analyze and utilize user-generated content, Reflectify creates personalized puzzles, memory quizzes, and reflective journaling activities. This approach not only enhances cognitive development but also encourages emotional well-being, especially as people age.
